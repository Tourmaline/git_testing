Finding removed code

git log -c -S'break'
git show $hash


Finding out when something broke


$ git bisect start
$ git bisect good 75c737cf5c9 # this is a commit that worked
$ git bisect bad HEAD         # last commit is broken
  # now compile and test
  # after that decide whether
$ git bisect good
  # or
$ git bisect bad
  # now compile and test
  # after that decide whether
$ git bisect good
  # or
$ git bisect bad
  # iterate until commit is found


This can even be automatized with git bisect run <script>
For this you write the script that returns zero/non-zero (success/failure)


Finding commits not merged upstream

Commits from current branch have not been merged to <branch>:

git cherry <branch>
